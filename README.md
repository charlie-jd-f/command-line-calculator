# command-line-calculator

This is a command-line calculator for basic operations ( + - * /).
I made this to practice the use of catching exceptions, as users could potentially input letters instead of numbers
or users could try to divide by zero. This would normally cause an error which would stop the code from runnings, but
I used a while loop iteration and try/except to catch these potentially errors and ask the user to try again.
